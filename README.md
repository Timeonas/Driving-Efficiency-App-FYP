# Driving Efficiency App

An Android application that helps drivers evaluate and improve their driving efficiency through real-time monitoring and analysis. The app uses smartphone sensors and optional OBD-II adapter data to provide insights into driving behavior and fuel economy.

### Project Definition

The goal of the project is to create a mobile app that can be used by anyone driving a car to evaluate
how efficiently they are driving. Driving efficiency can be improved by accelerating gently, maintaining
a steady speed, avoiding high speeds and more controlled deceleration. The app will use ~~the sensors
on a smartphone~~ OBD2 data to collect related data and it will then present a trip summary, and it will 
also be able to provide historical analysis. Fuel economy and potential savings can also be incorporated into the
data presented.
